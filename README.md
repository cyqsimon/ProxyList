# ProxyList
A Personal SwitchyOmega Proxy List of Selected Sites

Note that the purpose of this list is, has always been, and will always be ***personal use***, meaning:
1. I have no responsibility nor intention whatsoever to act as your tech support.
2. The sites on this list are limited to the ones I use, which is a very small subset of the set of all problematic sites. It most certainly ***will not*** cover all the sites you visit.

That being said, if you still want to use this list, simply set the raw URL of the list as your `Rule List URL` in your Switch Profile.

## gfw.sorl
An abridged list of banned (or practically banned) sites in China.

Notably, this list **deliberately excludes** sites that are pornographic in nature. You can chain your own list if you want those.

## slow.sorl
An abridged list of accessible but slow sites in China. Chain `gfw.sorl` as its downstream rule for best experience.

The metric for what defines "slow" is **completely arbitrary** to my personal liking. Your mileage may vary, depending on your location and network condition.
