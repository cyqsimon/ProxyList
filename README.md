# ProxyList
A Personal SwitchyOmega Proxy List of Selected Sites

Note that the purpose of this list is, has always been, and will always be ***personal use***, meaning:
1. I have no responsibility nor intention whatsoever to act as your tech support.
2. The sites on this list are limited to the ones I use, which is a very small subset of the set of all problematic sites. It most certainly ***will not*** cover all the sites you visit.

That being said, if you still want to use this list, simply set the raw URL of the list as your `Rule List URL` in your Switch Profile.

And [**Fuck GFW**](https://github.com/comwrg/FUCK-GFW).

## [gfw.sorl](/gfw.sorl)
An abridged list of banned (or not practically usable) sites in China.

### Note
 - This list **deliberately excludes** sites that are primarily pornographic in nature (sites like [Twitter](https://twitter.com) which merely allow such content do not count). You can chain your own list if you want those.
 - Some domains associated with a banned site may stay accessible (e.g. `twitchcdn.net`) even though the main site is not. For the purposes of this list, those sites are assumed banned as well.

## [slow.sorl](/slow.sorl)
An abridged list of accessible but slow sites in China. Chain [gfw.sorl](#gfwsorl) as its downstream rule for best experience.

### Note
 - The metric for what defines "slow" is **completely arbitrary** to my personal liking. Your mileage may vary, depending on your location and network condition.
